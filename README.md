# Assignment B4: Jane Austen Analysis and Pig Latin Function

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions for Assignment B4, where I completed two exercises:

1. **Exercise 1**: Analyzed the text of *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen. I visualized the most common words in the book after removing stopwords.
2. **Exercise 2**: Created a custom Pig Latin function with modified rules, including rearrangement and addition components. I implemented and tested this function in R.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following files:

1. **Assignment B4.Rmd**: The R Markdown file containing the code and explanations for both exercises.
2. **Assignment B4.md**: The knitted Markdown file for the assignment, generated from the `.Rmd` file.
3. **Assignment-B4_files/figure-gfm**: Contains the image of the plot generated for Exercise 1.
